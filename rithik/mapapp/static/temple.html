        <h2>The name "Sivan Malai" in Chengalpattu can refer to several temples, but most prominently to the ancient Vallam Hill Cave Temple, also known as the Pallavar Kugaivarai temple, a rock-cut cave temple built by the Pallava king Mahendra Varman approximately 1,300 years ago. Another possibility is the Pushpagiriswarar Temple in Pammal, which is also called Sivan Malai. There is also a Sivan Malai in Alapakkam, which is a separate Lord Shiva temple. </h2>
