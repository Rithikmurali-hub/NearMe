        <h2>Since 2004, KAYAK has been revolutionising the travel industry. Metasearch for travel? No one was doing it. Until we did.</h2>
        <h3>KAYAK was created for travellers, by travellers, born from a simple belief: travel makes the world better.

The more people we can help experience the world, the better it becomes for everyone. So we built something that makes getting there easier. We pioneered the concept of travel metasearch with every traveller in mind. Because no matter your budget, preferences or favourite providers, you should be able to compare all your options in one place.

We built the site we wanted to use: an experience that puts control back in travellers’ hands. No more searching hundreds of sites on your own - just a smarter, faster way to see all of your choices and plan trips with confidence.

Today, we’re proud to be the world’s leading travel search engine, processing billions of searches, partnering with hundreds of global travel brands and earning the trust of millions of leisure and business travellers worldwide. Yet, our core values remain exactly as they were on day one.</h3>
<h2>What we believe.</h2>
<h3>Transparency and choice belong to every traveller.
Our platform makes it easy to compare options, understand total costs and book with confidence.- No hidden fees. No surprises.

The magic happens when you can see all of your options.
KAYAK was designed to be comprehensive, surfacing offers directly from airlines and trusted third-party sources so travellers can see the full picture before booking.

We don’t play favourites.
We partner with hundreds of travel providers to display fares, schedules and amenities accurately and fairly. Our results are based on what’s best for the traveller - not on whom we partner with.

A transparent marketplace benefits everyone.
An open travel marketplace where travellers gain real choice is good for travellers and partners. By maintaining equal access to public fares and clearly labelling booking sources (“Book with Airline” or “Book with Partner”), we protect consumer trust and promote healthy, competitive distribution across the travel ecosystem.</h3>
